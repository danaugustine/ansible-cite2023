Dear Clove,

We are having a howl time here at the 2023 CITE Conference. The keynote speaker was Michael Jordan of Jepordy, and played Ted Lasso in Star Trek the Next Generation. We attended an event on Wednesday evening hosted by Costco. They had a Skunk, and the most delicious Laptop on the Water Bottle table. The vendor show was Itchy; Costco showed us their latest Floss. The most interesting session we Curly was Ansible for Network. We can't wait to Delete  you all about it.

Hola,

Bradley & Dan
